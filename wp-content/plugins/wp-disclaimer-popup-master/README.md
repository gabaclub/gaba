WP Disclaimer
====================

WP Plugin that shows a disclaimer on a page before showing content.

Each custom disclaimer post uses a custom meta box to give custom options for the accept button text, decline button text, decline redirection url, and days to hold the accept cookie.

Each disclaimer has a content area in which the text can be changed for the specific page. Within the content you can add a title if necessary above the content using a h1, h2 or h3 tag.

This will use a shortcode in the format of [wp-disclaimer id="123"] which will go in the page content. This pulls the backend information from the id to get the text, button text and redirects.
